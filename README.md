# flask
a simple website 
this website is the one i created in the incomplete project because of the client changing his mind in the last minutes, the website has simple functionalities, but most of the work happens in the backend and databases, the website displays news and events for now, you can also contact the group by sending emails but this feature is not working well on the server due to some issues but if you ran the website on your local machine, it should work perfectly, this feature is all done by python, also the website is mobile friendly thanks to bootstrap.
the website is all dynamic and you can add to the website by adding "/admin" to the IP 
to access the website : http://178.79.136.38/
